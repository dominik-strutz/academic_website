The aim of this library is to contain all the Bayesian Experimental Design algorithms impemented during my PhD. Currently a number of nested Monte-Carlo and variational algorithms are provided. Due to the early stage of my project documentation, tutorials and tests are missing currently. Those will be added in the coming years.
