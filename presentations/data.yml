      <p>
      This talk is about our recent on the Boule and Harmonica libraries and
      how they fit into our current and future research plans. It includes a
      live demo of using these tools to process real ground gravity data.

      It was an invited talk to the geophysical modelling group at GFZ. Thank
      you to Angela Maria Gomez Garcia for the invitation.

    abstract: |
      The Fatiando a Terra project is a collection of open-source Python
      libraries for geophysics which cover a range of functionalities, from
      data download and processing to modeling and inversion. Many of our tools
      are general purpose but we also focus on gravimetry and magnetometry.
      Development on the projected started in 2010 and has gone through several
      iterations as the team matured and established best practices for
      maintaining software projects in the open.
      This talk is an overview of the history and current iteration of the
      project, including a short demonstration of our current capabilities for
      downloading and processing gravity data. We will then move on to our
      plans for future directions of the projects and information of how you
      can get involved. Finally, we will briefly discuss some of the challenges
      and opportunities of adopting open-science practices.
