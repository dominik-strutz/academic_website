      This is an invited presentation about the past, current, and future of
      the Fatiando a Terra project. We will cover the current functionality,
      recent developments, and lessons learned along the way.

      The presentation is centered around a tutorial that walks you through the
      steps of transforming observed absolute gravity measurements into a grid
      of residual gravity disturbances at a constant height. The tutorial
      showcases some of the core utilities of all of our open-source libraries.

    abstract: |
      The Fatiando a Terra project (https://www.fatiando.org) was started in
      2010 as a Python library for visualization, forward modelling, and
      inversion across different geophysical methods. Over the following 8
      years, the project attracted new contributors and grew to include
      cutting-edge methods, toy examples for teaching, and helper functions for
      visualization. Standards around testing, documentation, and code style
      evolved and new tools appeared around the ecosystem (such as SimPEG,
      PyVista, Devito, and pyGIMLi), making some of our functionality redundant
      and outdated. In an attempt to better interface with the emerging
      ecosystem, we started a major restructuring of the code base in 2018.
      This presentation will cover the current available functionality and some
      of the lessons learned from developing, growing, and maintaining the
      project, including current challenges and our future plans.
